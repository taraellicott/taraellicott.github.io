A while ago I was listening to a lecture with by a leader in the tech field who was talking about all the great things that software engineers have brought us. Things like Yelp and Uber. I was thinking about all the downsides that all of these technologies have helped to create. All of the businesses that have been put out of business because of unfair bad Yelp reviews, the jump in suicide that has happened among NYC cab drivers because of the influx of Uber and Lyft basically destroying their livlihood. I guess that I'm a bit of a Debbie Downner. Anyway, that got my thinking about ethics and how it fits into this field.

The medical profession has the Hippocratic Oath (or some form of it) as a standard of ethics that a doctor is expected to adhere to when treating a patient. Do not harm - not actually in the Hippocratic Oath, but it's the basic message nonetheless.

As part of the ASCE engineers can take part in the <strong>Obligation of the Engineer</strong> and receive a steel ring to be worn as a reminder of their commitment to high ethics and professionalism.

This is way too Lord of the Ringsy for Me.

Anyway, what about software engineering?

Well, it's a relatively new profession, but there is actually an organization called IEEE (Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers)  along with the ACM(Association for Computing Machinery)<em> </em>that has created a Software Engineering Code of Ethics.

There are eight basic principles that a software engineer should adhere to. A lot of this stuff is pretty basic - it boils down to this: If you're a person, don't be an a**hole, and if you're a company, don't be evil.

1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

6. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

8. SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

Those are the basic guidelines, which were revamped to put the public at the top. This is pretty interesting if you think about it because what software engineers do, has a tremendous impact on the public, and they should really be thinking about the impact of the software that they create on the public. The priority shouldn't be to just create something cool, or to take the technology to the next level, but to think about the effects that the tech will have on the lives of people before you put it in people's lives, rather than after. Once it's out there it's out.

Recently Google decided not to extend its contract with the Defense Department for artificial intelligence used to analyze drone video, squashing a controversial alliance that had raised alarms over the technological buildup between Silicon Valley and the military.

And that's a good thing because we probably shouldn't be encouraging the military to use AI. Not that this is going to stop that. Mr. Rogers and I feel the same way about it.
