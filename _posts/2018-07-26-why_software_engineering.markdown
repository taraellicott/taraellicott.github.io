Well, why not?

When I was 19 I dropped out of a mechanical engineering program. I pretended like it was my choice because it technically was, but when I look back I was really a victim of circumstance.

Growing up, all the women around me were always smart. So I never doubted for a minute that a woman could do a job just as well as a man could. In high school, all the honors classes were filled with women. Of course, this was because the boys had better options when it came for schools to attend, but I didn't really get what that really meant at the time.

So I guess I was a bit naive when I went off to college. I remember sitting in a class with 500 other students. The professor told us to look to the student to our left. He said that by the end of the year half of us would be gone. He was right. I quit at the end of the semester.

One of the worse memories I have is of sitting in calculus class. It was the only class that I had with a female teacher. There was a group of men who would sit behind me and mock her for all of the errors that she made. She was not the best teacher, but she had earned professor status at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. What they did on a daily basis, insulting her intelligence was just sexist. It affected me in a major way. I regret that I never stood up for her. I don't think that I realized it at the time but it was because of incidents like that that I quit engineering.

I stuck with one class though - computer science - because I  thought that i might want to switch my major to cognitive science. I was having trouble though so I went to ask a group of former classmates - all engineering students - all men - if they could help me with a certain concept. There was a group of about eight students studying together as they often did. I had asked another student to explain this concept to me. He was a business major - so he had taken the CS class but in a very different form. I explained the concept to the group of eight males as it had been explained to me by  the business student.

The looked at me like I had eight heads. They laughed. They ridiculed me for my lack of understanding of this basic, fundamental computer science concept.

Did I mention that some of these guys were my friends? Like, my pretty good friends.

I cut off the final vestiges of my burgeoning engineering career that day. I quit the computer science class. I convinced myself that it was my choice. That I just wasn't good at it. I majored in anthropology. I became a bus driver to pay for school since quitting engineering meant that I had to give up my full ROTC sholarship.

And now twenty years later I decided to give it another shot. The computer science that is. Not the military. Definitely not the military.

What an inspiration I am!

Oh, but then, despite all my hard work, Flatiron decided to kick me out of the in-person program and push me into the on-line program. Well eff-ewe Flatiron.

How do I feel right now? Like I never should have bothered to try again. But, hey, who cares what I have to say because it's not like anyone really reads these blog posts, now do they?
