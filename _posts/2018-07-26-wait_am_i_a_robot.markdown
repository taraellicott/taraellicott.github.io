<h1>CAPTCHAs</h1>
So CAPTCHAs have gotten to be incredibly irritating lately. Scratch that. Sometimes they're super-easy, and you just have to check a little box and you're done.

And sometimes they're super irritating where you have to choose like twenty photos.

It was a lot simpler in the olden days when you had to type in the two words that you saw on the screen.

Simpler times!

I always wondering what the heck the meaning was behind those hard-to-read words. How did typing them in prove that I was a human?

So I decided to find out more about these annoying little tests and their evolution.

So CAPTCHA stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. That's a mouthful. But the most important phrase in there is probably "Turing test."

Who was Turing, you might be asking?

<h1>Turing Test</h1>
Alan Turing was a mathematician and in 1950 he proposed  an "imitation game", later called the "Turing test" to determine whether a computer can “think.” In this test, a remote human interrogator, within a fixed time frame, must distinguish between a computer and a human subject based on their replies to various questions posed by the interrogator. By means of a series of such tests, a computer’s success at “thinking” can be measured by its probability of being misidentified as the human subject. CAPTCHAs are commonly referred to as reverse Turing tests because instead of a human doing the testing, a computer is doing it.

Turing predicted that by the year 2000 a computer “would be able to play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than a 70-percent chance of making the right identification (machine or human) after five minutes of questioning.”

We're not even close to that, but the time's they might be a changin' soon and rapidly. More on that later.

<h1>ReCAPTCHAs</h1>
But anyway, back to CAPTCHAs. In 2000, 22-year-old Luis von Ahn was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon. He'd helped develop CAPTCHAs in order to prevent automated programs from doing things like buying up concert tickets to resell at a higher price. Humans, who have a visual recognition capacity that vastly outperforms even the best computers, generally do pretty well in identifying these distorted characters.

However, Ahn realized that there was a major flaw in the system that he'd designed because people were spending 500,000 hours every day doing pointless computations. He also realized that there were parallels between the fake text that they were asking people to decode and the distorted text that was produced when a document was scanned. About 20% of all scanned words are unreadable by optical character recognition (OCR), the computer process that “reads” printed materials.

So he realized that instead of having people decode fake text, he could have them decode distorted text from actual documents instead, so that their work was no longer wasted.  This idea earned him a MacArthur genius grant as he’d connected two inefficient uses of brain power to create a functional win-win scenario. Von Anh’s first project, reCAPTCHA, was digitizing the New York Times’ archive, which consists of more than 13 million articles.

So the computer would give a control, one word that it knew the correct spelling for, and another word that it wasn't yet sure of, from a book that had been photocopied to be digitized.

If a user spelled the control word correctly, the computer would assume that it was a human. It would give a number of users the same non-control word, and once a certain number of users had spelled the word the same way, they would assume that was the correct spelling and add it to the digitized database.

Not quite sure which one is the control word in this example, though.

<h1>Google</h1>
Google acquired reCAPTCHA in 2009 for an undisclosed amount for use in Google Books: Google’s ambitious effort to digitize every book in the world. As of October 2015, they’ve scanned over 25 million books but this project is not without controversy. There was a class action lawsuit by multiple publishers claiming copyright infringement, which Google eventually won.

In 2012 Google also started throwing in screenshots from Street View to identify addresses, street names, and traffic signs.

 

 

 

 

Google was also criticized because they were basically getting free labor through the reCAPTCHAs. Which leads me to my next question...
<h1>Hey Google...</h1>
<img class=" size-full wp-image-21 aligncenter" src="https://taraellicott.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/ways_my_mony.jpg" alt="ways_my_mony" width="960" height="720" />

I know that I've done my part to help out the Google Books project. But I've noticed that they've moved away from these types of questions. Now you get the simple checkbox, which is kinda creepy. How did things get so simple?

Turns out that Google uses a new algorithm that it is keeping secret but it involves keeping track of a user's IP addresses and cookies, and mouse movements. So if you wind up getting one of the screens with all the pictures, you're not doing a very good job of convincing the computer that you're a human.

<h1>On a Side Note - Google Duplex</h1>
On May 8th Google unveiled Duplex, an automated voice assistant that can accomplish tasks over the phone such as making restaurant reservations — has thrown a spotlight on how advanced AI can now carry on conversations that are so lifelike that even a human listener can be fooled. Duplex likely has/will pass the Turing test. As of May 4th Google removed the phrase "don’t be evil” from their code of conduct.
